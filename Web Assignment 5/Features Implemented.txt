Features Implemented:
Variables:

Example: $primary-color, $secondary-color, $font-family.
Custom Properties:

Custom properties (CSS variables) are used to store and reuse values.

Nesting:

Mixins are used for reusable blocks of styles that can be included in different selectors.
Example: @mixin btn, @include btn(rgb(130, 130, 193));.
